      <p>This is the index file for Project Push. It is displaying correctly, which means that I've taken a successful first step into the world of web development. If you’re reading this, I hope that you will continue to visit this website and offer feedback. It is part personal blog and portfolio for my coding projects as I work towards certification as a full stack developer.</p>

      <p>NOV26UP: Tonight I start making updates to Project Push, which will introduce many aesthetic changes. This means you'll see a lot more seagreens and royal blues replacing the current light blue haze. You'll -hopefully- also find the text to be more engaging and stimulating to read. I'll be doing work on the box model, taking the time to do somethings outside of it. Get ready for a more interactive experience over the next few weeks. Thanks for checking in!</p>

      <p>Now let's see if the Link below works:</p>
